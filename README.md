# Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model

## Introduction
This project involves working with a dataset using Python to perform data analysis and build a linear regression model. The steps include data processing, visualization, and machine learning.

---

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling data frames and loading CSV files.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building and predicting with the linear regression model.

---

## Dataset
The project uses a CSV file (**"reno_clio.csv"**) containing information about a car's year and mileage. The dataset includes the following columns:
- **year**: The car's manufacturing year.
- **km**: The car's mileage for that year.
- **age**: The car's age (2024 - year).

---

## Analysis and Modeling Process

### 1. Variable Definition and Data Types
The initial part of the code introduces Python data types and collection structures. This step demonstrates basic data types, lists, sets, and dictionaries.

### 2. Data Loading
The CSV file is loaded using **pandas**:
```python
import pandas as pd
car_data = pd.read_csv("reno_clio.csv")
```
This step enables the analysis of the dataset's basic properties.

### 3. Data Visualization
The relationship between "age" and "km" is visualized using **Matplotlib**:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(car_data["age"], car_data["km"], color="red")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Km")
plt.title("Age-Km Graph")
plt.show()
```
This graph helps understand how mileage changes as the car ages.

### 4. Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is created and trained using **Scikit-learn**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(car_data[["age"]], car_data["km"])
```
The model coefficients and intercept are obtained as follows:
```python
print("Coefficient:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
```

### 5. Predictions and Model Visualization
The predicted values are compared with actual values:
```python
plt.scatter(car_data["age"], car_data["km"], color="red")
plt.plot(car_data["age"], model.predict(car_data[["age"]]), color="blue")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Km")
plt.title("Age-Km Graph")
plt.show()
```
This visual makes it easy to observe the model's accuracy.

## Results
The key findings of this project include:
- There is a positive relationship between car age and mileage.
- The linear regression model successfully predicts mileage based on age.
- Meaningful coefficients were obtained through model training.

---

## How to Run
1. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
2. Add the **"reno_clio.csv"** file to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```
4. Review the outputs and visualizations.

---

## Future Steps
- Experiment with more complex models (e.g., polynomial regression).
- Evaluate the model's performance using different datasets.
- Include performance metrics (e.g., MSE, R^2).
- Expand on missing data handling and preprocessing steps.
